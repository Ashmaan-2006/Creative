                <h2>The Spirit of Queen's Engineering</h2>
                <p>Queen's Engineering is built on traditions that bring us all together. From the Grease Pole to jacket slams, every experience is a chance to make memories and build lasting connections. Here's a taste of our tradition:</p>
                <div class="rap-container">
                    <p class="rap-text">We slam, we mosh, we get so high, <br>
                    Climbing poles that touch the sky. <br>
                    Golden jackets gleaming bright, <br>
                    Queen's Engineering, we own the night! <br><br>

                    We go hard, we party fast, <br>
                    With traditions that always last. <br>
                    The Grease Pole's calling our name, <br>
                    We're all part of the same game! <br><br>

                    Highland Games and slamming tight, <br>
                    We do it right, we take flight. <br>
                    From Kingston streets to Clark Hall, <br>
                    Queen's Engineering, we stand tall!</p>
